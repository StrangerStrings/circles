Probably make it all based on ascii codes instead of letters

This way space bar can be more intergrated with the rest
and only change the styles in the if statement

Will have to do some kind of minus thing for shifted letter codes


maybe if spacebar then timeout before class comes off, also create..
i can do this, i'll just have a global variable that
is controlling the naming of the new div created by the space bar.
(because spacebar can't be pressed again before it's let off so the timing will work.)
->
space bar creates new div when pressed 
it's named (id) using a number, a global variable 
given random properties like before
when keyup, it is found with spaceCount
and the light-up class removed, but not the div
spaceCount is incremented after this..

Actually.. I don't want 3000 divs knocking about after a 20 minute jam, i'm gonna have to solve that.
I'm just gonna have to have 5-10 divs kncoking around and find them using the global variable,
and all the magic happens in the incrementor where if it's 10 it's 0 again.




Maybe have number keys change the colors

If any sh






Today just has something about it, it's not like yesterday, it's.. just more relavant.
